- desc: "I'm a passionate frontend developer with a keen eye for design. I'm a performance freak while *Debugger* is my middle name. I'm passionate of all sorts of techy areas, from IoT to frontend, so I build my own intelligent devices to help me in the yard.


  I'm also into wildlife and landscape photography, I jam in a two man band, I do woodworking, I cook and I'm very serious about my travelling."
