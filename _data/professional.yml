    "Silentale played a huge role in my career, making me step from a junior to a much, much more experienced developer while increasingly harder challenges came along. I had to deal with large-scale applications, big-data platform, and none of the challenges could just pass by me.


    It was here that I fell in love with bleeding edge technologies like Sass, Stylus, AngularJS, Zurb Foundation, HAML, Handlebars, Yeoman and Grunt."

    "At FlashXML I focused on developing WordPress Themes and offering support for them when the Support department couldn't solve the clients needs and questions. Other than that, I used to maintain and extend the official website and blog, and from time to time I had develop newsletters.
