I"Î<p>At FlashXML I focused on developing WordPress Themes and offering support for them when the Support department couldnâ€™t solve the clients needs and questions. Other than that, I used to maintain and extend the official website and blog, and from time to time I had develop newsletters.</p>

<p>This job helped me develop a sense for high quality web applications and also learn a lot about web standards, communicating with users and managing projects.</p>
