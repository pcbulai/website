I"ª<p>Iâ€™m a passionate frontend developer with a keen eye for design. Iâ€™m a performance freak while <em>Debugger</em> is my middle name. Iâ€™m passionate of all sorts of techy areas, from IoT to frontend, so I build my own intelligent devices to help me in the yard.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also into wildlife and landscape photography, I jam in a two man band, I do woodworking, I cook and Iâ€™m very serious about my travelling.</p>
