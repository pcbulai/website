I"w<p>Xivic is a small digital agency with clients. During our collaboration I was directly responsible of a small team of developers focused on what was at the time the companyâ€™s biggest client, Meineke. Our main goal was to build them a web application where users could search and locate nearby service shops, book a visit, track the progress and pay for the services.</p>
